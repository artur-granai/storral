## 🧭 Roadmap Purpose

This roadmap outlines the **strategic direction and evolution** of the Storral project over time.

It serves as:
- A **planning reference**
- A **communication artifact**
- A **long-term orientation tool**

Dates, phases, and milestones represent **research and development intentions**, not commercial commitments.

---

## 🧩 Organizational Structure Reference

The roadmap follows the conceptual structure defined in the project:

- **Storral Engineering** — Hardware, firmware, and engineering
- **Storral Labs** — Software, interfaces, and applications
- **Storral Orbit** — Infrastructure, network, and nodes
- **Storral Care** — Support, services, and recovery

Each division evolves independently while remaining conceptually aligned.
