## 🧩 Ecosystem Structure

Storral is organized into independent functional divisions that operate in an integrated manner:

- **🛡️ Engineering** — Secure hardware, firmware, and embedded systems  
- **🧪 Labs** — Applications, UX, experimentation, and prototyping  
- **🪐 Orbit** — Infrastructure, networks, sovereignty, and base services  
- **🩺 Care** — Support, education, documentation, and user experience  

Each division has technical autonomy, its own documentation, and well-defined responsibilities.

## 🧠 Internal Orchestration & Intelligence (Cortex)

The Storral project is supported by an internal AI-based orchestration system called **Cortex**.

Cortex acts as an **advanced execution and governance layer**, designed to operate with **high performance**, **high organizational throughput**, and **high availability**, meeting the demands of a **new generation of digital projects and operations**.

It offers capabilities such as:
- Structured agent coordination
- Governance and document standardization
- Internal audits and continuous validations
- Formal review and consolidation flows
- Structured decision support

More than automating tasks, Cortex **simulates real organizational dynamics**, operating as a living work structure.
Each agent acts from well-defined roles, reflecting human functions like analysis, validation, coordination, critical review, and decision consolidation — continuously, consistently, and traceably.

Instead of focusing on isolated tasks, Cortex enables **structured execution at scale**, combining traceability, quality control, and continuous feedback cycles.
This model allows decisions, reviews, and actions to occur with fluidity similar to that of a well-coordinated organization, but with the **precision, persistence, and availability of a computational system**, elevating the operational standard beyond traditional development flows.

This repository presents the **public results** of the work.  
Cortex, in turn, operates **independently behind the scenes**, sustaining planning, execution, and organizational coherence with a level of rigor typically only achieved by highly structured systems.
