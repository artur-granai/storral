# 📊 Sustainability Models Study (Academic Research)

> This document presents the **theoretical research** on funding and sustainability models applicable to long-term Open Source projects.

---

## 1. Analyzed Models

The project investigates the viability of different resource sources for maintaining decentralized technological infrastructure:

### A. Crowdfunding/Sponsorship
Analysis of platforms like GitHub Sponsors and Open Collective for server costs and testing hardware.
*Status: In feasibility study.*

### B. Grants and Research Funding
Mapping of institutions that fund privacy and security research (e.g., technology foundations, academic grants).
*Objective: Financial support for laboratory material.*

### C. Voluntary Donations
Decentralized mechanisms (e.g., Lightning Network) for spontaneous support from the scientific and technological community, without product reciprocity.

---

## 2. Academic Model Restrictions

According to the Academic Project Declaration:
- ❌ **No product sales:** Hardware is researched and documented, not commercialized.
- ❌ **No pre-sales:** There are no plans for early fundraising for mass production.
- ✅ **Focus on R&D:** Any eventual resource (donation/grant) is destined exclusively for research maintenance (purchase of components, supplies, server fees).

---

## 3. Partial Conclusion

The most suitable model for the current phase (Research & Extension) is **Voluntary Support (Sponsorship)** and **Research Funding**, ensuring freedom from commercial conflicts and maintaining focus on scientific knowledge production.
