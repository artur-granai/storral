# 🌱 Initial Concept — Storral

> A modular ecosystem designed for digital sovereignty and Bitcoin-based financial security.

## 💡 What is Storral?

**Storral** is a conceptual project focused on **user sovereignty, security, and self-custody** in the Bitcoin ecosystem.

It explores how software, hardware, infrastructure, and support can be combined into a **coherent, modular, and auditable system**, where control always remains in the hands of the user.

Storral is not defined as a single product.  
It is an **ecosystem of ideas**, designed to evolve over time.

---

## 🎯 Core Purpose

The core purpose of Storral is simple and non-negotiable:

> **Enable real control over digital value without intermediaries.**

Every concept within the project exists to support this principle.

---

## 🧠 Guiding Principles

Storral is guided by a small set of foundational principles:

- **User sovereignty first**
- **Security over convenience**
- **Transparency and auditability**
- **Modularity and separation of concerns**
- **No hidden trust assumptions**
- **Long-term sustainability**

These principles precede any technical, architectural, or organizational decision.

## 🧩 Conceptual Structure

Storral is envisioned as a **modular ecosystem** composed of independent but integrable domains.

Each domain represents a distinct responsibility within the system.

### 🛡️ Engineering  
Secure physical devices, firmware, and hardware-focused protection.

### 📱 Labs  
Applications, interfaces, and user-facing software.

### 🌐 Orbit  
Infrastructure, nodes, and direct interaction with the Bitcoin network.

### 🩺 Care  
Support, education, recovery flows, and user assistance.

This structure allows flexibility without forcing a single usage path.

## 🔗 Reference Documents

The concepts introduced here are expanded and detailed in other project documents:

- **`README.md`** — General overview, context, and project positioning  
- **`ARCHITECTURE.md`** — High-level system and security architecture  
- **`ROADMAP.md`** — Direction and evolution of the project  
- **`CONTRIBUTING.md`** — Contribution rules and development workflow  

These documents build upon the foundation defined in this initial concept.

## 🧠 Final Note

This document defines the **initial conceptual foundation** of the Storral project.

It is intentionally minimal.  
Further documentation expands on these ideas without replacing them.

The concepts presented here are intended to remain stable, serving as a long-term reference as the project evolves.
